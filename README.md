# Auto-ML
When youâ€™re training machine learning models, each dataset and model needs a different set of hyperparameters, which are a kind of variable. The only way to determine these is through multiple experiments, where you pick a set of hyperparameters and run them through your model. This is called hyperparameter tuning. In essence, you're training your model sequentially with different sets of hyperparameters. This process can be manual, or you can pick one of several automated hyperparameter tuning methods.
